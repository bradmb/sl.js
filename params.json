The unique id will also show next to the user's name in each message they send.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## What it looks like ##\r\nThis is the display for the default \"float\" configuration. If docking to the left/right side of the screen, you will instead get a narrow interface that extends from the top to the bottom of your page.\r\n\r\n### The welcome screen (if you don't pass a name in the config) ###\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SyIIp3o.png\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n### The chat interface with an ongoing conversation ###\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IXlHfFL.png\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n### What it looks like from a Slack channel ###\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/n1NcOYH.png\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n1. The .css and .js files from this script included in your page\r\n2. [A Slack API Token](https://api.slack.com/tokens)\r\n3. [The Slack Channel ID](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list/test) for the channel that you want to run this script in\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## How to install ##\r\nDownload a copy of the [latest release from the releases page](https://github.com/bradmb/sl.js/releases) and reference them in your code.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, simply grab the file off NuGet to ensure you have access to the latest package at all times:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPM> Install-Package sl.js -Pre\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to setup ##\r\n\r\nYour basic configuration items are simple: Your Slack token, the Slack Channel ID, and the DIV where this will use as the spot where all the elements are rendered:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar slConfig = {\r\n    token: 'SLACK-TOKEN',\r\n    channel: 'SLACK-CHANNEL',\r\n    element: 'PAGE-DIV-ID'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTo bind this interface to a button that will display on click, use this:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar sl = new SLjs.Button('BUTTON-ID', slConfig);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo bring up the interface immediately (no binding to a button), simply call this:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar sl = new SLjs.Interface(slConfig);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Extra configuration options ##\r\n\r\nThe configuration options listed above are the *minimum* options required. You are free to fill in additional parameters, including:\r\n\r\nParameter | Type | Description | Options\r\n--- | --- | --- | ---\r\nvisitorName | string | If filled out, the script will skip the question that asks the user for their name. Fill this in if you have some way to automatically identify a user's name | N/A\r\nvisitorIcon | string | This defaults to the *:speech_balloon:* emoji in Slack, but feel free to change this to any other emoji (default or custom) from your Slack instance. | N/A\r\napplicationName | string | This will override the default application name (SL.js) with your own. It's recommended you fill this parameter out, as it will show up to the user and in your Slack channel, allowing multiple sites or pages to point at one Slack channel, while easily identifying where the visitor is coming from. | N/A\r\nsupportGroupName | string | This shows in the user support interface, and will show what team the user is talking to. When the interface shows messages coming from Slack, it will attempt to show the Slack user's first name only, followed by this support group name. By default, this will show \"*Support Team*\". | N/A\r\nposition | string | Allows for docking the support interface to the left, right, or floating it in the center of the page. By default, this will float in the center of the page.| left, right, float\r\nworkDates | object | Allows you to specify the standard work hours that support is generally available. This will not prevent users from submitting messages, but display a notice that support may not be available. By responding to the user in Slack, this notice will be removed so the user can have a normal support conversation. | See Below\r\n\r\n## Work Dates: How To Configure ##\r\nStart hour and stop hour must be provided using the UTC time zone. You can leave out a day of the week and it will consider that a non-working day.\r\n\r\n**Example parameter configuration for work dates**\r\n```javascript\r\nworkDates: {\r\n    monday: true,\r\n    tuesday: true,\r\n    wednesday: true,\r\n    thursday: true,\r\n    friday: true,\r\n    startHourUtc: 15,\r\n    startMinutes: 0,\r\n    stopHourUtc: 1,\r\n    stopMinutes: 30\r\n}\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
